# Scalar — Knowledge Index

> The map of all deep context. `CLAUDE.md` (Tier 1) is always loaded; this index
> (Tier 2) is the single entry point to everything below, loaded on demand. For
> any task: *where does the knowledge live, and do I need it right now?*

## Foundation — the immutable inputs (owned by vision + the human)

| Doc | What's there | Read when |
|-----|--------------|-----------|
| `foundation/north-star.md` | The taste calibration — soul, five-second promise, the bar. The Ratchet reads this. | ✅ set — read for any desirability/taste call |
| `foundation/product.md` | **What Scalar is** — identity, moat, objects, capabilities, scope, model. The source of truth for what we're building. | ✅ set — read before any product/feature work |
| `foundation/valueprop.md` | **Positioning & messaging** — one-liner, differentiation table, pillars, voice. | ✅ set — read before any copy/positioning |
| `foundation/value-proposition.md` | Earlier value-prop notes (superseded by `valueprop.md`; kept for history) | ⚠️ legacy |
| `foundation/prd.md` | The build brief — features, rebrand, IA, integrations | ✅ set — read before feature work |
| `foundation/brand-kit.md` | Voice, look, feel | _not yet provided (colors set in `src/app/globals.css`; logo `public/logo.svg`)_ |
| `foundation/user-experience.md` | Flows, the felt experience | _not yet provided_ |

## Working knowledge (grows with the product)

| Area | What's there | Owned by |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `product/` | Specs, flows, requirements as they evolve | Vision + the human |

## Interfaces

**Maintenance:** update docs in the same breath as the change; one fact, one home;
date and status everything; index a new doc here the moment you add it. Stale docs
mislead — treat drift as a bug.
