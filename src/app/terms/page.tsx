          These Terms of Service (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to
          and use of Scalar, the CRM your agents run: structured storage, a real
          UI, and built-in intelligence operated by you and the AI agents you
          connect. By creating an account or using the service, you agree to
          these Terms. If you are using Scalar on behalf of an organization, you
          agree on its behalf and confirm you have authority to do so.
