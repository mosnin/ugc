// POST /api/webhooks/agentphone - AgentPhone's inbound-call webhook.
//
// THE FEATURE: the operator calls their own AgentPhone number and asks
// Scalar something out loud ("who do I need to follow up with today").
// AgentPhone transcribes the request and POSTs it here; we route the intent
// to the CRM, and return { speech } for AgentPhone to voice back to the
// caller.
//
// ── PAYLOAD SHAPE: OWED TO VERIFICATION ─────────────────────────────────────
// AgentPhone's inbound-call payload shape is UNVERIFIED (agentphone.ts admits
// the same for its own outbound response shapes). We do not have a live
// AgentPhone account to inspect a real request against, so extractTranscript()
// below guesses at plausible field names and is defensive about every one of
// them (typeof-guarded, never throws on an unexpected shape, degrades to null
// -> a generic "I didn't catch that" response). This MUST be verified against
// a real AgentPhone account before this is trusted in production - see
// docs/decisions/0014-voice-native-crm.md and scripts/voice-smoke.mjs.
//
// ── AUTHENTICATION: THE SECURITY-CRITICAL PART ──────────────────────────────
// This endpoint answers with real CRM data, so it MUST know exactly which
// Scalar user is calling before it does anything else. We do NOT trust
// anything in AgentPhone's payload for identity - not a phone number (spoofable,
// and we don't control the inbound number's provenance), not an agent/account
// id (shape unverified, and even if present we have no way to confirm
// AgentPhone signs its webhooks).
//
// Instead: each Scalar user who turns on voice in Settings gets a unique,
// high-entropy (256-bit) secret, `User.voiceInboundSecret`, generated server
// side (src/app/api/settings/voice/route.ts, collision-checked at generation
// time - see that file). Settings shows them the exact webhook URL to paste
// into AgentPhone's inbound-webhook config:
// `.../api/webhooks/agentphone?key=<secret>`. On every inbound call, AgentPhone
// hits that exact URL, so the `key` query param IS the caller's identity - a
// capability URL, the same pattern Stripe Connect, Zapier, and most
// third-party inbound-webhook receivers use for per-tenant endpoints. We look
// it up with a direct equality match (findFirst against a plain, indexed
// column - NOT a DB-level unique constraint; see the schema comment on
// `voiceInboundSecret` for why, uniqueness is guaranteed at generation time
// instead); no match, no voice, no enabled flag, no connected AgentPhone key
// -> refuse (401/501). We never fall back to "the only configured user" or
// any other implicit identity - if we cannot securely identify the caller, we
// refuse rather than guess, full stop.
