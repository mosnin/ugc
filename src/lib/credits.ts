  // of 1: this call does ~200x the embedding work of a single-text action
  // (remember/recall below) and is the one call in this file capable of
  // firing up to 200 OpenAI requests worth of tokens at once, so it keeps a
  // visibly higher price than a single-embed action even though both round

  // Three orders of magnitude below 1 credit - not a real cost-recovery

  // credit) rather than leave it free, for policy consistency: remember is
  // the one memory tool that calls a paid external provider (OpenAI) to
  // create new data, the same shape as every other metered action, and the
  // MCP server's own stated policy is "credits are spent only when an
  // action pulls real data from the outside world / calls an outside paid
  // provider." recall, below, is priced at 0 (see recall's own note by its
