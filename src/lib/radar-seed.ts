// Away-window guarantee: when a user finishes the first run and sets an ICP,
// seed ONE recurring Radar (intent monitor) from that ICP so their agent keeps
// working while they're away - which is what makes The Pulse fire reliably on
// the next session instead of being a coin-flip.
//
// Guardrails (this auto-spends, so it is bounded on purpose):
//   - Idempotent: only seeds if the user has NO monitors yet (never piles on,
//     never double-creates).
//   - Provider-gated: no EXA key -> no monitor (nothing to run).
//   - Credit-capped by construction: every monitor run debits `monitor_run` via
//     spendCredits (see radar-run.ts), which throws + skips when the balance
//     can't cover it. So a free account's radar simply stops when credits run
//     out - it can never overspend.
//   - Weekly cadence keeps the ongoing cost low; the FIRST run is scheduled a
//     few hours out so there's fresh away-window activity by the user's next
//     visit (the Pulse needs a delta since last-seen).
//   - Fully toggleable: it is a normal monitor, so pause/delete in Radar. It is
//     named so the user knows it is the auto one.
