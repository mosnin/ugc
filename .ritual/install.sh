✓ STAGED — the Ritual is wired into CLAUDE.md, but it is not active yet.

  NEXT · step 2 of 2 — open Claude in this repo.
  It will perform the setup Ritual: write your project's memory, stand up docs/,
  and ask you (in a sentence or two) what you're building and who it's for — your
  North Star. That part is yours to give; it can't be faked. Answer it, and the
  four gates go live and start compounding.

  Until then, Claude can read the methods but has nothing to calibrate against.
DONE
