# AGENTS.md - working rules for this repo

## Enrichment accuracy - never attach the wrong record (hard rule)

Enrichment (LinkedIn, email, phone, firmographics, anything) must ALWAYS attach
to the correct person/company. It is NEVER acceptable to save data for a
same-name stranger or a different company. This has caused real bugs and must
not happen again, ever.

Rules for any enrichment/lookup code:
- Verify identity before saving: the candidate must match on the person's name
  AND their company/domain (or title) before it is accepted. Matching on name
  alone is forbidden (too many same-name people).
- Prefer NOTHING over a wrong value. If a confident match cannot be verified,
  return null and tell the user "couldn't find it" - never guess.
- Provider lookups must be keyed by a strong identifier (work email, company
  domain), not just a display name.
- Reference implementation: `exaFindLinkedIn` in `src/lib/exa.ts` requires both a
  name and company match. Keep that bar for every new enrichment path.

## Copy - never use em dashes (hard rule)

The application must NEVER use em dashes (the long dash) or en dashes anywhere:
not in UI copy, code, comments, docs, commit messages, or model-generated text.
Use a comma, period, colon, parentheses, or a plain ASCII hyphen (-) instead.
This is non-negotiable. When writing any prose, reach for a hyphen, never the
long dash.

## Icons - keep it tasteful

Do NOT use the "icon inside a tinted rounded box/circle" badge pattern (e.g. a
`bg-primary/10` rounded square wrapping a single lucide icon). It looks generic
and "vibe-coded." Use clean typography and layout instead; use icons sparingly
and only as functional affordances inside buttons, nav/dock items, and compact
list rows - never as decorative chips above headings or beside stats.

## Design system

Before building or restyling any UI, read `DESIGN.md` - the durable spec for the
Scalar aesthetic (baby-blue + white light-default color tokens, type, the
eyebrow/masthead/panel patterns, the animated ASCII field + its conventions,
motion/easing, mobile rules). Keep new work consistent with it; if you change a
token or pattern, update `DESIGN.md` too.

## This is NOT a vanilla Next.js app (Next 16, App Router)

Don't assume Next ≤14 APIs - verify against the installed version. In particular:
middleware is `src/proxy.ts` (not `middleware.ts`); dynamic route `params` are a
`Promise` (await them); theme-color comes from `export const viewport`; icons/manifest
use file conventions (`app/manifest.ts`, `app/apple-icon.tsx` via `next/og`).
The build compiles the app and does not change database schema. Apply reviewed
schema changes separately with `pnpm db:deploy` before releasing a feature that
depends on them. Verify changes with
`./node_modules/.bin/eslint <files>` + a build before committing.
