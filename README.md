# Scalar

The CRM your agents run. Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript,
Tailwind v4, Prisma on Supabase Postgres, Clerk auth, Stripe + x402 billing.
Agents operate the CRM over MCP; deep context lives in `CLAUDE.md` and
`docs/README.md`.

## Local setup

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in keys
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

- `pnpm build` compiles the app only. It no longer runs `prisma db push`: the
  preflight needed `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` at build time, which preview
  deploys do not have, so every deploy failed before Next ever compiled.
- **Apply schema changes deliberately, before releasing anything that depends
  on them:** `pnpm db:deploy` (or `pnpm db:push`) against the target database.
  It is additive and refuses destructive changes without an explicit flag -
  never add `--accept-data-loss` casually.
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` (vitest), `npx tsc --noEmit` before shipping.

## Environment doctor

This app has ~15 optional-but-load-bearing integrations, each gated behind an
env var, each failing differently when missing (some 501, some silently
no-op, some throw at request time). Run the doctor before you assume
something is broken:

```bash
pnpm run doctor   # note: `pnpm doctor` (no `run`) invokes pnpm's own
                  # built-in doctor command instead, not this script
```

It reports PASS / MISSING / PARTIAL per integration, grouped the same way as
`.env.local.example` (Auth, Database, Discovery providers, Enrichment
providers, Agent runtime, Billing, Rate limiting, MCP auth), and ends with a
summary count. It never prints secret values, only which env var names are
set.

The same report is available as JSON at `/api/health` (public, no auth) so it
can be curled after a deploy with no shell access to the server:

```bash
curl https://<your-deployment>/api/health
```

Both the CLI and the route read the same check logic from
`src/lib/env-doctor.ts`, so they can't drift apart.

## Production requirements (founder actions)

- **Upstash Redis (required):** set `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and
  `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`. Without them every rate limit is per-serverless-
  instance and bypassable across autoscaled instances; the app logs a SECURITY
  error once per instance until configured.
- `OAUTH_SIGNING_SECRET` (falls back to `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` with a warning).
- Stripe: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_*`
  (including `STRIPE_PRICE_TEAM` for the team plan).
- Clerk: enable Organizations and subscribe the webhook to `organization.*`
  and `organizationMembership.*` events (Teams).
- Supabase: run `prisma/supabase-setup.sql` section 4 (pgvector HNSW index)
  once in the SQL editor; `db push` cannot create it.

## MCP

The agent-facing server is `/api/mcp/mcp` (streamable HTTP; SSE at
`/api/mcp/sse`), authenticated with per-user API keys (`scl_...`, minted in
Settings) or OAuth. The tool contract is documented in
`plugins/scalar/skills/scalar-mcp-agent/SKILL.md`.

Smoke-test a live server (proves list limits are enforced; the key is never
printed):

```bash
SCALAR_API_KEY=scl_... pnpm smoke:mcp                 # production endpoint
SCALAR_API_KEY=scl_... node scripts/mcp-smoke.mjs https://<preview>/api/mcp/mcp
```
